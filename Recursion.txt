**RECURSION**

LEC1:
    > when a function calls itself until a specifical condition is met is called recursion
    > condition used to stop the function calling is called the base condition
    > Stack Space- the functions which are yet to be completed(returned) are stored in a stack space
    > Recursion Tree- representation of the function call flow is done with the help of a recursion tree
    > Stack Overflow- executing recursion with no base class leads to stack overflow

LEC2:
    > Print name N times using recursion- 
        void f(i, n){
            if (i>n) return; //base condition
            cout<<name;
            f(i+1, n);
        }
        main(){
            int n;
            cin>>n;
            f(1, n);
        }

        SC- O(n)
